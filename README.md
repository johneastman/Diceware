# Diceware
This is an implementation of the Diceware password generation methodology. This process involves rolling a die to generate a 6-digit identifier, which is paired with a word in [diceware.txt](https://github.com/johneastman/Diceware/blob/master/diceware.txt). After completing this process any given amount of times, concatenate the words that have been genereated and separate them by a delimiter [1].

I learned about Diceware from this [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA) video:
