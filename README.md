# Diceware
This is an implementation of the Diceware password generation methodology. This process involves rolling a die six times to generate a six-digit identifier, which is paired with a word in [diceware.txt](https://github.com/johneastman/Diceware/blob/master/diceware.txt). After completing this process any amount of times, concatenate the words that have been genereated and separate them by a delimiter [[1](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html)].

I learned about Diceware from this Computerphile video (check out their channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA)):

### Usage
This program will generate a report (see an example: `report.txt`)
